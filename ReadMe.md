# 🌍 Energy Consumption Data Analysis Report

This Power BI project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing **global energy consumption** across various countries, sectors, and time periods. It provides insights into household vs. industrial energy use, fossil fuel dependency, renewable energy adoption, and carbon emissions.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The report explores energy consumption trends from **2000 to 2024** across 10 countries:
- **Australia**
- **Brazil**
- **Canada**
- **China**
- **Germany**
- **India**
- **Japan**
- **Russia**
- **UK**
- **USA**
